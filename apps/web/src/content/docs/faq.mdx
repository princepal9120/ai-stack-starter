## General

### What is AI Stack?

AI Stack is an opinionated CLI that scaffolds production-ready AI applications with your choice of architecture, database, authentication, and AI providers. See the [Quick Start](/docs) to get started.

### Do I need to install anything globally?

No. Run the CLI directly with your package manager:

```bash
npx create-ai-stack-starter@latest
```

### Which package managers are supported?

npm, pnpm, bun, and yarn are all supported.

### What Node.js version is required?

Node.js 20+ (LTS recommended).

### Can I use this with an existing project?

The CLI is designed for new projects. You can manually copy patterns from generated projects or wait for the `add` command to extend existing AI Stack projects.

## Choosing Options

### What architecture should I choose?

- **Next.js Fullstack**: Best for rapid prototyping, Vercel deployment
- **FastAPI + Next.js**: Best for ML teams, complex AI pipelines
- **TypeScript Backend**: Best for TypeScript teams, edge deployment

### Which database provider is best?

- **Neon**: Serverless Postgres, great for Vercel
- **Supabase**: Postgres with realtime, auth, storage
- **Turso**: Edge SQLite, globally distributed
- **SQLite**: Local development only

### Drizzle or Prisma?

Both are excellent. Choose:
- **Drizzle**: Lighter, SQL-first, better TypeScript inference
- **Prisma**: More features, better tooling, larger ecosystem

### Which LLM provider should I start with?

- **OpenAI**: Proven, extensive documentation
- **Anthropic**: Long context, great for documents
- **Ollama**: Free, local development, privacy

## Common Issues

### API key not working

1. Check the key is set in `.env.local`:

```bash
cat .env.local | grep API_KEY
```

2. Verify the key format is correct
3. Check the key has required permissions

### Database connection failing

1. Check `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
2. Ensure the database is running
3. Check network connectivity/firewalls

### Vector database not connecting

1. Check `QDRANT_URL` or equivalent is set
2. Start the vector database container:

```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
```

### Rate limits

Implement retry logic:

```typescript
try {
  await createCompletion({ ... });
} catch (error) {
  if (error.status === 429) {
    await sleep(1000);
    // retry
  }
}
```

### Build errors

1. Check all environment variables are set
2. Run type check:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

3. Clear cache and rebuild:

```bash
rm -rf .next node_modules
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

## Project Structure

### Where are generated files?

See [Project Structure](/docs/project-structure) for detailed layouts by architecture.

### Can I customize the generated code?

Yes! The generated code is yours. Modify anything to fit your needs.

### How do I add new pages?

For Next.js, create files in `app/`:

```
app/
├── about/
│   └── page.tsx    # /about
└── blog/
    └── [slug]/
        └── page.tsx # /blog/:slug
```
